## ðŸ’¡ Idea:
Create a Flutter Project in order to apply the knowledge studied.
The project should follow:
* Consumption of the following API:
[https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=pt-BR](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=pt-BR)
* The Home Page must have:
  * Highlighted random movie;
  * Watch again (no need to create logic of which movie was watched or not, just show the movies that is returned from the API randomly);
  * Movies cover;
  * Top 10 movies;
  * 3 lines of categories you prefer (the API returns the movie category, so the movies that are listed really need to belong to the category).

* One page with information, trailers for each movie.
  * In place of the trailer, the banner can be the movie (backdrop);
  * Title;
  * Description;
  * The buttons doesn't need to have any action;
  * Similar titles.
