## üí° Idea:
Create a Flutter Project in order to apply the knowledge studied.
The project should follow:
* Consumption of the following API:
[https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=pt-BR](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=pt-BR).
* The **Home Page** must have:
  * Highlighted random movie;
  * Watch again (no need to create logic of which movie was watched or not, just show the movies that is returned from the API randomly);
  * Movies cover;
  * Top 10 movies;
  * 3 lines of categories you prefer (the API returns the movie category, so the movies that are listed really need to belong to the category).

* One **Information Page**, containing data for each movie.
  * In place of the trailer, the banner can be the movie (backdrop);
  * Title;
  * Description;
  * The buttons doesn't need to have any action;
  * Similar titles.

## üöÄ How to execute the project:
To run and view the project, you will need to follow the next steps.
  * First you **must have Flutter installed in your machine**, to know more about this, see the doc: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install;
  * **Create an account** in https://www.themoviedb.org/ to get your **API KEY**;
  * **Create an .env file** at the root directory of the project, following the .env_example file and **paste your API KEY into the variable API_KEY**;
  * Run the command to install the project dependencies.
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```
